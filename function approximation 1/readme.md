### PURPOSE:
the purposed of this folder is to store solutions for problems using function approximation methods for policy gradients and value function methods.

Mountian Car notebook is a first attempt at function approxmiation approaching the mountian car problem in chapter 10.1

This also includes tiling found here byy Sutton:

Cart Pole notebook is a second attempt at appication of function approximation approaching the cart pole problem using radail basis functions to help engineer features.

From here we get into more 'fun' methods like vanilla dqn, dqn for atari, policy gradients, a2c and other fun things.
